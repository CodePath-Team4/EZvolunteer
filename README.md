## Overview
### Description
EZvolunteer is a networking app allowing organizations in need of volunteers or donations to be connected to volunteers or sponsors.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Networking
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps.
- **Story:** Organizations can advertise volunteering positions, or list events they need sponsors for. Other users are then able to browse the app and apply to some volunteer work posted by some organization, or donate money to help fund an event.
- **Market:** Any type of organization could choose to use this app, and anyone can choose to volunteer. 
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as users want depending on how much volunteer work they would like to do, or how many volunteering positions they would like to advertise. 
- **Scope:** We would start by letting potential volunteers scroll through all the different posts sorted by category (food, shelter, concert etc.) and/or location. People can choose to search for volunteer work within a specified distance from their location; users can choose to only display the events within a 10, 20 or 50 mile radius for example.
